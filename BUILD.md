# ⚙️ Building

To build, you need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Enter the following command in the terminal to build the project:
 - **Android APK**
    ```
    flutter build apk --flavor main
    ```
    You can also split APK into different architectures:
    ```
    flutter build apk --flavor main --split-per-abi
    ```
    or
    ```
    flutter build apk --flavor main --target-platform [android-arm|android-arm64|android-x64]
    ```
    The built APK will be located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.

 - **Linux binary**

    Note: for support system tray in GNOME, please install [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) or similar extension.

    Before building, make sure that the following dependencies are installed on the system:
    - **gtk3**
    - **libsecret**
    - **libjsoncpp**
    - **libappindicator** (GTK3)
    - **libsqlite3** (and development version)
    - **gettext** (for build only)

    Development versions for these packages are also required for building.
    
    To enable Linux support, enter the following command:
    
    ```
    flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
    ```

    Then run the following command:

    ```
    flutter build linux
    ```

    The built binary will be located in the `build/linux/x64/debug/bundle/` directory (or `build/linux/arm64/` for arm64 builds). The contents of the `bundle` directory must be fully copied.

 - **Linux Snap package**

    Note: for support system tray in GNOME, please install [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) or similar extension.

    Before building, make sure that the `snapcraft` dependency is installed on the system.

    Then run the following command:

    ```
    snapcraft
    ```

    The resulting `.snap` file can be installed as follows:

    ```
    sudo snap install output_file_name.snap --dangerous
    ```
 - **Linux Flatpak package**

    Note: for support system tray in GNOME, please install [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) or similar extension.

    Before building, make sure that the `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder` dependencies are installed on the system.

    Then run the following commands:

    ```
    flatpak install org.freedesktop.Sdk
    ```
    ```
    cd flatpak
    ```
    ```
    flatpak-builder --user --install builddir ru.proninyaroslav.libretrack.yaml --force-clean
    ```
